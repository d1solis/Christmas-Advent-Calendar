        To ensure our recipe is gluten-free, caffeine-free, peanut/tree nut-free,
        dairy-free, plant-based, organic and vegan.. I will list some of the ingredients 
        that fall under these categories below just to get a feel for what we're gonna be
        working with! P.S. If anytime, you feel that 
        we may need to change our ingredients to better suit you, that's not a 
        problem at all! ‚ò∫Ô∏è I will be more than happy to do more research so that 
        we can always make delicious holiday treats for us to share together! ü§ç

        Below is the link to the full recipe I found, along with the instructions!
        The website also includes great additional details that I think is worth
        checking out! I already have a mental note of some alternatives in case 
        we are unable to try the original recipe! Remember, we can always include 
        and discard any ingredients to make the recipe more Rashad-friendly! 
        I can't wait to bake with you! ‚ò∫Ô∏èü§ç
