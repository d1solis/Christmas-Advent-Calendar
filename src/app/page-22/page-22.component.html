        SURPRISE! Welcome to Haloday Shorts: Wort Wort Edition! ‚ú® Here I have 
        included some funny Halo related / Elite-inspired holiday clips that I
        thought were cute and funny! I thought it would be fun to bring a bit of 
        the Covenant into the Christmas spirit for you. I hope you enjoy them! 
        Merry Wortmas, my Spartan! ‚ò∫Ô∏è ü§ç
