                    <p class="text">
                        This represents the feeling of LaLa being irresistibly 
                        drawn to you, not just physically but emotionally and 
                        spiritually. Shad tempts LaLa to open up in ways she 
                        hasn't before, inviting her to embrace vulnerability 
                        and intimacy.

                        Shad inspires LaLa to be her best self, pursue her 
                        dreams, and embrace life with courage. His support and 
                        love have been transformative for her. Shad isn‚Äôt just 
                        someone LaLa loves; he‚Äôs her first love, her best friend, 
                        and her soulmate.

                        Shad reminds LaLa that even in moments of doubt or 
                        weariness, their bond is worth fighting for. The challenges 
                        they‚Äôve overcome together have only strengthened their 
                        connection, showing that their love is built on resilience 
                        and a shared commitment to never give up on each other.

        SURPRISE! Welcome to Tarot Reading! Here I have randomly chosen 
        three of my special <i>"Witch-Alien-AI-Nerd"</i> tarot cards from my deck 
        and used my witchcraft to magically present them to you here! These 
        special cards essentially reveal the reasons why I love you so much! ü§ç 
        There are definitely many more reasons why I love you, and I'm sure you 
        are well aware of that by now. üôàü§ç But to make this more concise and 
        as simple as possible, I have randomly boiled just <i>some</i> of my 
        reasons down to three (in no particular order or importance)! 
        <br>
        P.S. You look really cute today Shad ü•∞
    </p>

    <p>
        INSTRUCTIONS: Use your mouse to hover over or around the image to flip 
        the card over, thus revealing my special reasons for loving you so
        much! ü§ç
