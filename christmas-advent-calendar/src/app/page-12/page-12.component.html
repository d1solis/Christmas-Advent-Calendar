        SURPRISE! Welcome to Memory Lane! ‚ú® Here I have compiled all of the 
        pictures that we've taken together since September 29, 2024 up to now!
        ‚ò∫Ô∏è I remember the first time we played a Roblox game together. It's crazy
        to me how even though that was only three months ago that we played, it
        feels like forever ago. ü§ç
    </p>

    <p>
        Bangkok Dinner was our first official game we played in Roblox, and it 
        was so much fun! I remember how excited I was to show you how to navigate
        the game! You were so cute trying to make your avatar eat egg rolls and 
        rice. ü§£ü§ç It was the cutest Roblox date I've ever been to! ü§ç After
        you got the hang of things, we played a bunch of other games together 
        like 2 Player obbies, Welcome to Bloxburg, and my favorite, Adopt Me! ü§ç
    </p>

    <p>
        Even though we've only played Roblox together for a short period of time,
        I've enjoyed every single moment of it. I even made sure to take at least
        one picture of every game we played together! I hope you enjoy looking 
        back at all of the memories we've created together, and I can't wait to
        creat more with you in the future Shad! ü§ç Also, thank you for always 
        playing Roblox with me and healing my inner child. ü§ç It means so much 
        to me that you take the time out of your day to play silly games with me, 
        and I appreciate it more than you know. I love you Shad! ü§ç
    </p>
